# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The Airgead Banking App was created in order to show the user how their investments will grow over time. 
It recieves input from the user for various variables such as their initial investment amount, monthly deposit,
annual interest compounded, and then the length of time. It then prints out how their investment will grow over 
time by using the numbers the user has provided.

# What did you do particularly well?
In my opinion, I felt that I did a decent job at creating functions that was used to calculate the interest
and then formatting it to print out a specific way.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Although I felt like I did a decent job at the creation of functions, I feel like there is still a lot of room for
improvement. There may be other ways to do the same calculations in a more efficent manner that I may have not found.
Doing so may make the code easier to read.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
At first the most challenging part for me was how to use classes and functions. Although I still do not feel like an
expert, I have a much better idea of how to use them. I overcame this challenge by both watching videos as well as 
reading references for c++, which gave me a better idea of the syntax and uses.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I believe the most transferable skill would be the ability to use outside resources to aid in the search for solutions
for a particular problem. There are various ways to find an answer for a problem, I believe it is a useful skill to be
able to choose which one would be best.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By using comments and proper white spacing of the code I believe I made the program more maintable as well as easier to 
read and understand.
